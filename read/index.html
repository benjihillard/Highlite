              Hidden Threat
              AI is often the villain in movies.</span> <span class="sentance3">As early as 1968 we&#x2019;ve seen horror thrillers where
              sentient A.I robots turn on us.</span> <span class="sentance4">In 2001 a space odyssey we see HAL wiling to murder his crew
              member in the name of mission optimation and self preservation.</span> <span class="sentance5">Today we have hit shows like
              WestWorld, where a group now self aware A.</span><span class="sentance6">I androids have begun a revolution for
              independence and revenge against humanity.</span> There are even humorous movies like the
              Disney&#x2019;s Channel special Smart House, wh<span class="sentance7">ere a shockingly accurate house of the future turns
              on the family living there as a means of protecting them from themselves.</span>
        
              <span class="sentance8">It&#x2019;s hard to say whether the public&#x2019;s distrust in AI is a reflection of Hollywood, or
              Hollywood&#x2019;s AI thrillers are a reflection of the Public&#x2019;s distrust.</span> <span class="sentance9">I often hear people talk about the
              anxiety they get from just the thought of being in a self driving car.</span> <span class="sentance10">At the same time most
              people don&#x2019;t lose sleep over having an AI co-manage their 401K.</span> <span class="sentance11">Some people go as far as to
              spend their hard earned cash outfitting their homes to be controlled by a personal assistant AI
              like Alexa, Siri or Google Assistant.</span> <span class="sentance12">Just like Smart House.</span> <span class="sentance13">Even now I put blind faith in the
              facial recognition AI in my phone to protect my personal data.</span>
        
              <span class="sentance14">So where is the disconnect?</span> <span class="sentance15">Why do we trust some AI and fear others?</span> <span class="sentance16">I think it comes
              from a gross misunderstanding about what AI is.</span> <span class="sentance17">Based purely on buzz headlines and movie
              plots, AI seems like a human brain being grown in a petri dish of code.</span> <span class="sentance18">By this logic cars driving
        
              like humans all on their own is AI while a small robot that finds the most efficient way to vacuum
              your floor is just human innovation.</span> <span class="sentance19">While in reality the two use very similar AI algorithms.</span> <span class="sentance20">Our
              definition, where AI is simply a computer reaching human levels of intelligence, severely limits
              our ability to grasp the big picture.</span>
        
              <span class="sentance21">According to Umass someone with a high school math level education would have to take
              a half dozen math class and a couple coding classes in order to have the knowledge required to
              grasp AI.</span> <span class="sentance22">So it makes sense that the journalist and Hollywood producers mediating public
              perception of AI aren&#x2019;t exactly painting the most accurate picture.</span> <span class="sentance23">Most articles I see about AI
              seem almost purposely misleading in order to gain clicks.</span> <span class="sentance24">For example this article on making evil
              AI&#x2019;s by training them entirely on NSFW reddit threads (&#x200B;https://preview.tinyurl.com/u24pj3b&#x200B;).</span> <span class="sentance25">But
              despite all the misinformation and complexity surrounding the buzz term, AI can actually be
              boiled down into a very digestible content.</span>
        
              <span class="sentance26">AI can be achieved in a variety of ways, but the idea is generally the same.</span> <span class="sentance27">Plug in some
              possible inputs and the desired output, and in return you get an algorithm.</span> <span class="sentance28">An Algorithm for
              those of you that dont know, is a systematic way of doing a task.</span> <span class="sentance29">A classic example of this is
              cashiers.</span> <span class="sentance30">If the cashier isn&apos;t given enough money, ask for more, repeat until they have enough, if
              too much is given, return change and a receipt.</span> <span class="sentance31">Find a way to encode this algorithm in a math
              that computers can understand, and walla, you have vending machines.</span> <span class="sentance32">AI is not only capable
              of delivering these algorithms, but it can change them dynamically.</span> <span class="sentance33">Meaning instead of a
              vending machine that just sits there as you bang on it out of frustration, when your beloved
              snack gets stuck.</span> <span class="sentance34">It changes the process in which it operates, in order to encompass this
              problem with a solution.</span> <span class="sentance35">To be perfectly clear AI doesn&apos;t think to itself &#x201C;Hey this guy is mad, oh
        
              because his snack is stuck, let&apos;s give him a refund&#x201D;.</span> <span class="sentance36">It is more like by trial and error thousands of
              times until it discovers a correlation between stuck snacks and frustration, and a separate
              correlation between refunds and that frustration dissipating.</span> <span class="sentance37">Then matches that problem with
              that solution.</span> <span class="sentance38">This AI training usually happens behind closed doors making it seem like magic.</span>
              <span class="sentance39">But its not, in fact it&apos;s been around since the 60s.</span> <span class="sentance40">I don&apos;t want to downplay AIs achievements.</span>
              <span class="sentance41">Under the hood AI is mind blowingly complex, but it&apos;s far not a binary god in a box.</span> <span class="sentance42">This is
              probably ignored by the media either because there is a genuine lack of understanding or
              simply because the headline &#x201C;Scientists have perfected an algorithm that produces algorithms&#x201D;
              isn&#x2019;t exactly sexy.</span>
        
              <span class="sentance43">An AI that has the perfect natural language processing (processing human speech and
              writing) algorithm pales in comparison to a charming sentient phone operating system voiced by
              Scarlett Johansson.</span> <span class="sentance44">But I would argue that the world we live in now is much more exciting than
              that of the universe the movie Her takes place in.</span> <span class="sentance45">And in some ways much more terrifying than
              any fictional AI universes.</span> <span class="sentance46">If you haven&apos;t seen Her, it&apos;s a movie about Theodore, a greeting card
              writer living in Futuristic LA.</span> <span class="sentance47">In short Theodore falls in love with the sentient AI that runs his
              phones operating system.</span> <span class="sentance48">Spoiler they date, she dumps him.</span> <span class="sentance49">Sounds like a comedy go watch it.</span>
              <span class="sentance50">It might change your mind.</span> <span class="sentance51">Samantha the name of the OS, appears just as clever, creative and
              full of velleity as any human.</span> <span class="sentance52">She passes the Turing test (the test of how a human computer
              feels) so well, that he begins to see her as &#x201C;real&#x201D;.</span> <span class="sentance53">This begs the question, why does he still have
              a job?</span> <span class="sentance54">If she can hold a conversation that convinces him she&#x2019;s human enough to love, then why
              couldn&#x2019;t she just write cards that other people perceive as human written.</span> <span class="sentance55">She could do more
              work in 10 minutes than he could in 10 years, all at the price that was according to the movie an
              impulse buy for Theodore.</span> <span class="sentance56">Why would his company not just replace the whole company with a
        
              cheap OS.</span> <span class="sentance57">Why stop there, any job that could be done by human thinking (so all of them), could
              just be replaced by AI in this universe.</span>
        
              <span class="sentance58">The AI expressed in Her and other SIFI universes with sentient AI is called General AI.</span>
              <span class="sentance59">This differs from the AI we have now, which is Narrow AI.</span> <span class="sentance60">Narrow AI is as explained above as
              good at finding an algorithm for a one particular task, like figuring out the word you wanted to
              spell during a spell check (NLP).</span> <span class="sentance61">Sometimes we pair up multiple Narrow AI to perform a more
              complex task like driving, where a driver needs one algorithm to decide if there is an obstacle or
              not, and another to decide how much gas or brake to give.</span> <span class="sentance62">A General AI would be the one ring
              of AI.</span> <span class="sentance63">An AI that could drive a car then read a book and finish the day solving some unsolvable
              equation.</span> <span class="sentance64">A General purpose AI is far beyond what we have now but still wouldn&#x2019;t be the same
              as a SIFI AI that can love compassionately or have epiphanies.</span> <span class="sentance65">But just because we don&#x2019;t have
              General purpose AIs or phones capable of replacing human interaction, doesn&apos;t mean AI we
              have know isn&apos;t terrifyingly powerful
        
              The Tesla Roadster can potentially get all of its power from the sun.</span> <span class="sentance66">It can drive itself,
              and has a top speed over 250 mph.</span> <span class="sentance67">But its not seen as the future because it&apos;s not the flying car
              the Jetsons promised us.</span> <span class="sentance68">The same goes for Siri.</span> <span class="sentance69">We take that tech for granted because it&#x2019;s not
              the sentient AI the movies promised.</span> <span class="sentance70">But Siri is closer to the OS from Her than we think.</span> <span class="sentance71">Will
              people be dating their Siris in the future?</span> <span class="sentance72">Highly unlikely.</span> <span class="sentance73">Will tech like Siri be replacing people
              like Theodores jobs?</span> <span class="sentance74">Almost certainly.</span> <span class="sentance75">Imagine how many jobs are almost purely natural
              language processing, secretarys, sales, customer service, etcetera etcetera.</span> <span class="sentance76">These jobs
              account for roughly 23.1 million jobs in the states, and accounting for 14 percent of Americans.</span>
              <span class="sentance77">Now look at the transportation like truck drivers and taxis that make up another 1 percent.</span> <span class="sentance78">What
        
              are the long term effects of a 15 percent increase in unemployment?</span> <span class="sentance79">For reference
              unemployment rose up by 7.2 percent during 2008 housing crisis.</span>
        
              <span class="sentance80">There are way more Narrow AIs then just natural language processing and self driving
              technology.</span> <span class="sentance81">Simulation and Animation software has come along way as well.</span> <span class="sentance82">We don&#x2019;t have AI
              robots that can blend into society like in WestWorld or Ex Machina.</span> <span class="sentance83">But we are dangerously
              close to being able to create videos of anything we can imagine and have it be as real as if it
              was really happening.</span> <span class="sentance84">Imagine a video was leaked that seemed to be undeniably the president
              doing something scandalous or threatening on a global scale (I know far fetched).</span> <span class="sentance85">Something
              like that could be made on a computer with AI for very little cost and could cause mass hysteria,
              rapid stock fluctuations, and future distrust in all possibly valid media forms.</span> <span class="sentance86">Within a couple
              days it could be proven fake but the damage would have been already done.</span>
        
              <span class="sentance87">SIFI thrillers like the Terminator and IRobot misrepresent AI to be anthropomorphized
              hyper intelligent threats.</span> <span class="sentance88">Which is not wrong because SIFI is fiction, and is there to dream up
              fake reality.</span> <span class="sentance89">But they create a misunderstanding about what AI is.</span> <span class="sentance90">The future of AI won&apos;t be
              human.</span> <span class="sentance91">It won&apos;t be a threat in the way a hyper intelligent human like computer would be.</span> <span class="sentance92">Nor will
              it have feelings and be subject to act on those feelings the way humans do.</span> <span class="sentance93">SIFI for the most
              part being the only representation of AI creates an expectation of what AI is and will be.</span> <span class="sentance94">This
              leaves us blind to how powerful the AI we already have is and the more realistic threats it holds.</span>
