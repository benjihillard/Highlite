# Highlite

Highlite is a minimalist web application that aims to assist those who have trouble reading due to Dyslexia, ADHD, and other cognitive disabilities. Highlite takes in a PDF, Then software creates an interactive page where the user can adjust the format of the text to the readability that best suits them. This includes changing the font to dyslexic friendly styles and colors, as well changing backgrounds to optimize text contrast. Highlite is a distraction free page that allows the user to highlight text by paragraph, sentence or even one word at a time. Users can toggle off these highlights at their own rate via keystrokes or on a timer if they are feeling competitive. Highlite ensures maximum readability of documents, even if it has to be read one word at a time.
