# Our idea:
Highlite is a web tool that aims to assist those who have trouble reading due to Dyslexia, ADHD, and other cognitive disabilities. Highlite takes in a range of input texts from PDFs and Docx files to Epubs and copy+pasted text. The software creates an interactive page where the user can adjust the format of the text to the readability that best suits them. This includes changing the font to dyslexic friendly styles and colors, as well changing backgrounds to optimize text contrast. Highlite is a distraction free page that allows the user to blackout text by paragraph, line and even word by word. Users can toggle off these blackouts at their own rate via keystrokes or on a timer if they are feeling competitive. Highlite ensures maximum readability of documents, even if it has to be read one word at a time.

# Important data:
* User preferences for readability: font size, kerning, line spacing, and how much text they want visible at a time.
* Document the user is reading, as well as past documents the user has saved
* User email, if registered, so saved documents and formatting preferences can be saved to that id.

# Division of labor:
* Benjamin: Responsible for HTML/CSS on upload page, as well as early upload implementation (WIP)
* Corey: Responsible for HTML/CSS on read page
* Alden: Responsible for final pass CSS/HTML edits, wireframes and visual design, and writeup.

# User interface:
* wireframes:

the above are the first-pass wireframes/design mockups we used to inform our CSS/HTML mockups. Our website has two main pages the user interacts with, so we wireframed both.
