Corey Sarkis (Github: csarkis7):
* Updated spanify typescript file that parses text
* Properly set and stored parsed strings into a JSON object
* Tried to help with working on some of the background code
* I just wanted to make a note here about the issue I reached out to the instructors about. I wasn't able to run the server on  
  my machine so I couldn't really work and test the backend code.
* Also, a major refactoring of the code was done and now in insights, it shows that I didn't make any commits until the end of 
  last month. This is obviosuly not true, and I'm not sure why it shows that.
