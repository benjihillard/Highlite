Innovative Idea

Highlite is a minimalist web tool that aims to assist those who have trouble reading due to Dyslexia, ADHD, and other cognitive disabilities. Highlite takes in a range of input texts from burnt PDFs and Docx files to Epubs and copy+pasted text. The software creates an interactive page where the user can adjust the format of the text to the readability that best suits them. This includes changing the font to dyslexic friendly styles and colors, as well changing backgrounds to optimize text contrast. Highlite is a distraction free page that allows the user to blackout text by paragraph, line and even word by word. Users can toggle off these blackouts at their own rate via keystrokes or on a timer if they are feeling competitive. Highlite ensures maximum readability of documents, even if it has to be read one word at a time.

Important Components

Important components will express for setting up a server. We will need a function to extract the text from text documents. We need a function to parse the text and tag all the words, sentences and paragraphs. We need a function that changes color and style schemes based on user input.
We need an iterator that is either controlled by keystrokes or a timer. We need a function that controls what text gets blocked out based on where the reader is.
