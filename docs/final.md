# Overview:
Highlite is a web application that aims to assist those who have trouble reading due to Dyslexia, ADHD, and other cognitive disabilities. Highlite takes in PDFs as input and displays the text found in the document on a web page. The software creates an interactive page where the user can adjust the format of the text to the readability that best suits them. This includes changing font styles and colors, as well changing backgrounds to optimize text contrast. Highlite is a distraction free page that allows the user to highlight text by paragraph, sentence and even word by word. Users can toggle off these highlights at their own rate using keystrokes. Highlite ensures maximum readability of documents, even if it has to be read one word at a time.
